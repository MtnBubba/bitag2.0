Estimated Time Commitment:
Paper to be completed within no more than THREE months (reduced from four)

Weekly conference calls of ONE hour per week
Contributions of text and text review/comment estimated at ONE hour per week

Scope:
As a result of COVID-19, many schools transitioned to online classes. However, some students lack broadband access in their 
homes which has created what has been referred to as the "homework gap". Some schools have attempted to temporarily close 
this gap by provisioning WiFi access points outside on their grounds (such as in school buses). However, there is much 
potential variation in the performance, reliability and scalability of how this type of service is offered that merits 
brief technical exploration. 

The paper will initially describe the primary means by which schools have tried to meet this technical need. The paper will 
also describe the technical challenges that are known to occur in such solutions, based on network operator, equipment 
manufacturer and software developer experience. 


This paper will assess technical options and recommendations for things such as (1) backhaul from the WiFi network to the 
Internet, (2) authentication and abuse traceback, (3) WiFi-layer optimizations, (4) active queue management (AQM) 
optimizations to provide better quality video conferencing, (5) traffic shaping mechaisms to provide service at peak times, 
and (6) other technical recommendations. [TBD: The paper may also make recommendations on how to measure the quality and 
reliability of these solutions in a standardized way and to enable measurement of technical value (i.e. RoI).]

Paper Length:
Limited to no more than 25 double-spaced pages, including graphics, tables, appendecies, footnotes and references.
