Scope:
Many parties have an interest in accurately understanding the capacity & performance of different parts of the Internet in 
normal times. Significant recent changes in the Internet usage have occured as a result of COVID-19 and made it even more 
critical to have an accurate technical understanding of how the Internet is performing. Comparing the results of different 
tools is difficult, sometimes because how metrics are calculated from collected data varies from platform to platform or 
even researcher to researcher using the same underlying data. 

This paper assesses frequently used Internet speed test metrics and makes specific technical 
recommendations on a simnple set of standardized metrics that can be used to enable better comparisons between 
different measurement tools and improve overall understanding of speed test data.

OUT of Scope:
Assessment of different speed testing tools & recommendations on the best speed testing techniques.

Paper Length:
Limited to no more than 25 double-spaced pages, including graphics, tables, appendecies, footnotes and references.
