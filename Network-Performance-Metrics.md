Scope:

Many parties have an interest in understanding the capacity and performance of
different parts of the Internet in normal times and under normal operating
conditions. 

Significant recent changes in the Internet usage have occurred as a result of
COVID-19, which have made it even more critical to have an accurate technical
understanding of how the Internet is performing. Comparing the results of
different performance measurement tools is challenging, for several reasons.

1. The technical methods for performing the measurements can vary.
2. The methods for post-processing the measurements to produce statistics can
   also vary.

This paper described and explains frequently used Internet speed test metrics
and makes specific technical recommendations for standardized measurement
methods and corresponding metrics to enable better general understanding of
speed test data, as well as meaningful comparisons of measurements and metrics
across different tools and datasets.

OUT of Scope: Assessment of different speed testing tools & recommendations on
the best speed testing techniques.

Paper Length: Limited to no more than 25 double-spaced pages, including
graphics, tables, appendecies, footnotes and references.
