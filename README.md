This is a repository to support the work of the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG). For more information please see our website at https://www.bitag.org/.

We invite comment on our queue of potential topics at https://github.com/bitag-twg/bitag2.0/blob/master/Future-Topic-Queue.md

We will also post information about new topics that we decide to work on and invite interested parties to join these work efforts.

If you are interested in participating technically, please email dsicker@bitag.org. Please note that (1) your organization does NOT need to sign a membership agreement or pay membership or sponsorship due for you to participate technically. In addition, all reports include a disclaimer to the effect that just because you participated technically that this does not necessarily mean that your organization agrees with or endorses the report that is released from the BITAG.
